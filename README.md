# Automatic-Silicon-Detector-Calibration



● The script performs automated analysis of the Ra226 spectra

● Built around the ROOT framework

● Automatic identification the peaks in the spectrum using TSpectrum

● Fitting a gaussian function in the vicinity of the peak in order to find the true peak

● Correlating identified peaks with known energies of the alpha particles in the decay chain

● The parameters of the linear fit are displayed in terminal

● Execution takes ~10 seconds
